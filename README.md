[Winter Field Day](https://www.winterfieldday.com/) is a once a year 24hr
emergency preparidness event for radio amateurs (Hams). During the event, we try
and make as many radio contacts with other Hams in a 24 hour period. Bonus
points are awarded for operating outside or using alternate power sources, such
as battery/solar/wind. You can find out more about Winter Field Day by visiting
the [WFDA](https://winterfieldday.com/). You can find out more about amateur radio
by visiting the [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/).

The logger is written in Python 3, and uses the PyQT5 lib. Qt5 is cross
platform so it might work on everything. I have tested it on Linux, Rasperry
Pi OS and Windows 10. This code is based off of a logger I had done earlier
using Python and the curses library wich can be found
[here](https://github.com/mbridak/wfd_py_logger) and one written for ARRL
Field Day [here](https://github.com/mbridak/FieldDayLogger).

The log is stored in an sqlite3 database file 'WFD.db'. If you need to wipe
everything and start clean, just delete this file and re-run wfdlogger

The logger client will generate a cabrillo for submission, An ADIF file so you
can merge contacts into your normal Log, and a Statistics file with a band mode
breakdown.

The server if used, will generate a group cabrillo file to submit.

## Caveats

WFD only has a generic digital mode designator 'DI', which gets exported to the
cabrillo file. But ADIF and CloudLog needed something else, So I Chose RTTY.
Feel free to change it to what ever you will use. Just search for the two
places in the code 'RTTY' is used and Bob's your dads brother.

## Changes since last release

WFDA preferres `DG` as the mode indicator for digital.

Changed the RAC sections for 2023. Thanks for the heads up WB8ERJ!

Added a group contact aggregation server. So multiple clients can participate in
WFD together.

Added N1MM XML status packets. So you can use
[Kyle AA0Z's Node-Red dashboard](https://github.com/kylekrieg/Node-Red-Contesting-Dashboard).

Added power, scoring and bonus changes for 2023.

## Installing Client

```bash
pip install wfdlogger
```

## Running Client from source

The client source package is available [here](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger)

Install Python 3, then required libs via pip.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Or if you're the Ubuntu/Debian type you can:

`sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-requests python3-bs4 python3-lxml python3-dicttoxml`

Just make wfdlogger.py executable and run it within the same folder, or type:

`python3 wfdlogger.py`

## The Server

### Server install

```bash
pip install wfdserver
```
### Server source

[wfdserver](https://github.com/mbridak/wfdserver)

## What to do first

On first run, there will be a dialog box asking you for your call class and
section. if you need to change this later, the entry fields can be found at
the bottom of the screen.

If you're participating as a member of a group, do not put your groups/club
call as your call. Enter your own call. The group call will be polled from
the server.

![Snapshot focused on bottom of window](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/yourstuff.png)

## Logging

Okay you've made a contact. Enter the call in the call field. As you type it
in, it will do a super check partial (see below). Press TAB or SPACE to advance
to the next field. Once the call is complete it will do a DUP check (see below).
It will try and Autofill the next fields (see below). When entering the
section, it will do a section partial check (see below). Press the ENTER key
to submit the Q to the log. If it's a busted call or a dup, press the ESC key
to clear all inputs and start again.

## Features

## Radio Polling via flrig or rigctld

If you run flrig or rigctld on a computer connected to the radio, it can be
polled for band/mode updates automatically. Click the gear icon at the bottom
of the screen to set the IP and port. There is a radio icon at the bottom of
the logging window to indicate polling status.

![Snapshot of settings dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/catSettings.png)

## Cloudlog, QRZ, HamDB, HamQTH useage

If you use either Cloudlog logging or QRZ/HamDB/HamQTH lookup you can click
the gear icon to enter your credentials.

Q's are pushed to CloudLog as soon as they are logged.

The QRZ/HamDB/HamQTH lookup is only used to get the Op name and gridsquare for
the call. Mainly because when a Q is pushed to CloudLog it will not show as a
pin on the map unless it has a gridsquare. So this is a scratch my own itch
feature. HAMDB.org is used by default since it's free. If both are checked it
will it will use QRZ then fallback to HAMDB.

## N1MM packets for Node-Red Dashboard

If you wish to use Kyle AA0Z's Node-Red contest dashboard, edit these settings.

![N1MM settings](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/n1mm_settings.png)

## XPlanet marker file

If you use QRZ/HamdDB/HamQTH lookups you can also generate an
[XPlanet](http://xplanet.sourceforge.net/) markerfile which will show little
pips on the map as contacts are logged.

![Snapshot of xplanet window](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/xplanet.png)

The above launched with an example command:

```bash
xplanet -body earth -window -longitude -117 -latitude 38 -config Default -projection azmithal -radius 200 -wait 5
```

## Editing an existing contact

Double click a contact in the upper left of the screen to edit or delete it.

![Snapshot of edit qso dialog](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/editqso.png)

## Super Check Partial

If you type more than two characters in the callsign field the program will
filter the input through a "Super Check Partial" routine and show you possible
matches to known contesting call signs. Is this useful? Doubt it.

![Snapshot of main screen focused on super check partial output](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/scp.png)

## Section partial check

As you type the section abbreviation you are presented with a list of all
possible sections that start with what you have typed.

![Snapshot of main screen focused on section check partial output](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/sectioncheck.png)

## DUP checking

Once you type a complete callsign and press TAB or SPACE to advance to the
next field. The callsign is checked against previous callsigns in your log.
It will list any prior contact made showing the band and mode of the contact.
If the band and mode are the same as the one you are currently using, the
listing will be highlighted, the screen will flash, a bell will sound to alert
you that this is a DUP. At this point you and the other OP can argue back and
forth about who's wrong. In the end you'll put your big boy pants on and make
a decision if you'll enter the call or not.

![Snapshot of main screen focused on dup checking output](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/dupe.png)

## Autofill

If you have worked this person before on another band/mode the program will
load the class and section used previously for this call so you will not have
to enter this info again.

## CW

### CW Settings

Support is provided for both cwdaemon and PyWinkeyer.

![Settings dialog tab for CW](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/cw_settings.png)

Defalt port for cwdaemon is 6789 and for PyWinkeyer is 8000.

### CW Macros

The program will check in the current working directory for a file called
`cwmacros.txt` It will parse the file
and configure the row of 12 buttons along the bottom half of the window.
The macros can be activated by either pressing the corresponding function key,
or by directly clicking on the button. You can check the file to glean it's
structure, but it's pretty straight forward. Each line has 4 sections separated
by the pipe `|` character.
Here's an example line.

`R|F2|Run Exch|{HISCALL} {MYCLASS} {MYSECT}`

The first field is an `R` if the macro is to be shown while in Run mode.
Otherwise an `S` for Search and Pounce. The second field is the function key
to program. The third is the text label to put in the button. Lastly the
fourth is the text you would like to send.

A limited set of substitution macros are offered.

`{MYCALL}`
`{HISCALL}`
`{MYCLASS}`
`{MYSECT}`

These are pulled straight from the onscreen input fields. Combined with normal
text this should have you covered for most of your exchange needs.

### CW Macros (Run vs S&P)

You can toggle the macros in use between Run and Search and Pounce by clicking
the button to the left of the Generate Logs button at the botton right portion
of the screen.

![Picture showing buttons](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/run_sp.png)

This can also be used to reload the macros if you edit them while the program
is running.

### cwdaemon speed changes and stop sending

If you are using cwedaemon for sending, you can use:

`CTRL+Esc` to abort sending.

`PgUp` Increase sending speed.

`PgDown` Decrease sending speed.

## When the event is over

After the big weekend, once you've swept up all the broken beer bottles and
wiped the BBQ sauce off your chin, go ahead and click the Generate Logs button.

![Snapshot of main screen focused on generate logs button](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/genlog.png)

This will generate the following:

An ADIF log 'WFD.adi'.

A Cabrillo log 'Yourcall.log'. Which you edit to fill in your address etc. If
your not using Windows, you must ensure whatever editor you use uses CR/LF
line endings. Cause whatever they use at the Winter Field Day society will
choke with out them. To be safe you might want to run it through 'unix2dos'
before submitting it.

A 'Statistics.txt' file which breaks down your band mode usage. Each unique
band/mode combo is a multiplier.

## Group / Club logging

I have added a group contact aggrigating server. This can be run on the same
computer as the client program, or on a separate dedicated PC or Raspberry Pi
on the same network.

![Picture showing main server screen](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_pic.png)

## Server configuration

The configuration file for the server is a JSON file 'server_preferences.json'.
It's generated automatically on the first run of the server `wfdserver`.
So start the server then press CTRL-C to quit it, then edit the josn file. 

```json
{
    "ourcall": "W1AW",
    "ourclass": "3O",
    "oursection": "ORG",
    "name": "Hiram Maxim",
    "address": "225 Main Street",
    "city": "Newington",
    "state": "CT",
    "postalcode": "06111",
    "country": "USA",
    "email": "Hiram.Maxim@arrl.net",
    "bonus": {
        "altpower": false,
        "outdoors": false,
        "notathome": false,
        "antenna": false,
        "satellite": false
    },
    "mullticast_group": "224.1.1.1",
    "multicast_port": 2239,
    "interface_ip": "0.0.0.0",
    "node_red_server_ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "node_red_server_port": 12062
}
```

Feel free to leave the last 3 items as they are unless you have good 
reason not too. The rest should be straight forward.

Under the bonuses section, if your group qualifies for a bonus, put `true` next
to the type of bonus.

## Client configuration for groups

In the settings dialog there is now a tab labeled 'Group Operation'.

![Picture showing settings dialog tab](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/group_server_settings.png)

Go ahead and place a check next to 'Connect to server'. Rejoyce and let
merriment be had by all. Be sure and have your callsign already set before
checking this. If you forgot, Uncheck it, set your callsign and then check it.

A couple of things will change on the client when this is done. You will see
that your callsign will disappear and be replaced with your clubs call that the
server reports. The portion of the screen where all the different ARRL sections
are displayed will be replaced by a group chat window and a column showing the
station call, band and mode of other participants.

![Picture showing logger screen changes](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/group_chat.png)

If more than one operator is on the same band/mode, their names will be
highlighted in the operators list. Feel free to yell at eachother in the chat.

![Picture showing band and mode conflict](pics/band_conflict_client.png)

## Chat Window

The chat window is pretty straight forward. If someone mentions you in the chat
that line will be highlighted with an accent color. If you find the font size
does not work for you, can adjust the size by: Placing your mouse cursor in the
chat window, then rotate your mouse wheel while holding down the Control key.

There is one command you can type into the chat window that may be of use.
if you type @stats into the window the server will dump out the groups stats
into the chat.

```text
Server: 
Band   CW    PH    DG
 160     0     0     0
  80     0     0    25
  40     0   159     0
  20     1   162   126
  15     0     0     0
  10     0     0     0
   6     0    17     0
   2     0     0     0

Score: 1284
Last Hour: 271
Last 15: 81
```

Since most people will not be able to see the screen of the server, if it has
one at all. You may find this useful.

## How to know the server is there

Most likely, the server will be in some other tent/building/area of the room.
Every 10 seconds or so the server will send out a UDP network packet saying
it's there. As long as your client keeps seeing these packets the group call
indicator at the bottom of the screen will look like:

![Picture showing server status](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_okay.png)

But if about 30 seconds go by with no update from the server, the indicator
will change to:

![Picture showing server status](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/server_not_pinging.png)

Go check on it.

## Logging reliability

As mentioned before, We're using UDP traffic to pass data back and forth to the
server. UDP traffic is a 'Fire and forget' method. Akin to a bunch of people
in the same room yelling at eachother. Everyone can hear you, but you don't
know if anyone heard what you said. This has both advantages and disadvantages.
One advantage is that your program is not stuck waiting for a reply or timeout,
locking up your user interface. The disadvantage is you have no idea if anyone
took note of what you had said.

This works fine in a local network since the traffic doesn't have to survive
the trip through the big bad tubes of the internet. That being said, someone
may trip on a cord, unplugging the router/switch/wireless gateway. Or someone
may be trying to use WIFI and they are Soooooo far away you can barely see
their tent. Or worse you have EVERYONE on WIFI, and there are packet collisions
galore degrading your network.

To account for this, the client logging program keeps track of recent packets
sent, noting the time they were sent at. The server after getting a packet,
generates a response to the sender with it's unique identifyer. Once the client
gets the response from the server, it will remove the request on the local side
and print a little message giving you a visual confirmation that the command was
acted upon by the server. If the server does not respond either because the
response was lost or the request never made it to reply too. The client will
resend the packet every 30 seconds until it gets a reply.

But all this may still result in the server not having a copy of your contact.
To account for this, when the "Generate Logs" button is pressed on the client,
the client will resend all the logged contacts that have not gotten responses
from the server. You can keep doing this, if need be,  until it gets them all.

There is a visual indicator giving you an idea of how many if any contacts have
not been verified. The `Generate Logs` button will change serving this purpose.

![picture of generate log button showing count of unverified contacts](https://github.com/mbridak/WinterFieldDayLogger/raw/main/pics/unverified_indicator.png)

The client will resend all the unverified contacts to the server as part of
the log generation process.

Chat traffic is best effort. Either everyone sees your plea for more beer or
they don't. No retry is made for chat traffic. Just get your butt up and make
the trip to the cooler.

## Generating the cabrillo file

If any of the networked clients presses the 'Generate Logs' button on their
screen, the server will be told to generate it's cabrillo file, it will be
named 'WhatEverYourClubCallIs.log'.

Later you can also launch the server with '-l' flag on the command line
and the server will generate the log and then exit.

## I'm sure there are short cummings

It's early days, and I've mainly tested the operations with the client logging
program and several simulated operators, see file in `testing/simulant.py`.
Real world use for Winter Field Day outside of January is hard to come by. So I'm sure
there are a couple of things I forgot, or didn't account for.

If you are part of a group of linux using Hams, please take this for a spin and
tell me what I missed or could do better. Like a dry run, to make sure I'm not an idiot.
